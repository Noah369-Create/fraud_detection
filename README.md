# End-to-End Credit Card Fraud Detection Model using 2023 Dataset

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the development of an **End-to-End Credit Card Fraud Detection Model** using a dataset containing credit card transactions made by European cardholders in the year 2023. The dataset consists of over 550,000 transaction records, which have been anonymized to ensure the privacy of cardholders' information.

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model capable of detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. The model is trained using a variety of features derived from transaction data, and it leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains the following details:

- **Number of records:** 550,000+ transactions.
- **Anonymized data:** Sensitive cardholder information such as card number, name, and address has been anonymized.
- **Features:** The dataset includes multiple transaction-related features, including transaction amounts, time, and various anonymized features that represent different characteristics of the transactions.
  
### Key Columns:
- **Time:** The number of seconds elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
- **V1-V28:** These are anonymized features that represent transaction-related attributes (e.g., amounts, locations, etc.).
- **Amount:** The transaction amount.
- **Class:** The target variable. 0 indicates a legitimate transaction, while 1 indicates a fraudulent transaction.

### Data Source:
This dataset is publicly available for research and development purposes, typically found on repositories like Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Objectives

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the data for training by handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding labels.
2. **Model Development:** Implement and evaluate various machine learning models to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.
3. **Performance Evaluation:** Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to evaluate model performance.
4. **Deployment:** Create a deployable model that can make predictions on new transaction data.

## Model Overview

In this project, we experiment with various machine learning algorithms, including:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **XGBoost**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

The models are evaluated based on performance metrics, and the best-performing model is selected for deployment.

## Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing:
- **Handling Missing Data:** The dataset is checked for missing values, which are then imputed or removed if necessary.
- **Feature Scaling:** Features such as transaction amounts are scaled using **StandardScaler** to normalize the range of values.
- **Class Imbalance Handling:** Since fraudulent transactions (class 1) are rare, techniques like **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** are applied to balance the dataset.

### 2. Model Training:
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets (usually 80-20%).
- Train the models using different algorithms.
- Tune hyperparameters using techniques like **Grid Search** or **Random Search** to find the best combination of hyperparameters.

### 3. Model Evaluation:
- Evaluate each model using common metrics:
  - **Accuracy:** Measures the percentage of correctly predicted transactions.
  - **Precision:** The proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.
  - **Recall:** The proportion of true positive predictions among all actual fraudulent transactions.
  - **F1-Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall, used as a balance metric.
  - **ROC-AUC:** Measures the area under the ROC curve, representing the model's ability to distinguish between classes.

### 4. Model Deployment:
- Once the best model is selected, deploy it using frameworks like **Flask** or **FastAPI** to make real-time predictions for new transactions.
